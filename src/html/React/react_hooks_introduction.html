  <h3 class="font-head">a.What are hooks</h3>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">In React, hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. They were introduced in React 16.8 to provide a more concise and intuitive way to manage state and side effects in functional components, without the need to use class components.</p><br/>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">Hooks enable you to reuse stateful logic across different components, which was previously only possible with class components and 
    higher-order components (HOCs).</p><br/>
  <h3 class="font-head">b.Why do you need hooks</h3>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">Hooks were introduced in React to address some limitations of class components and to provide a more intuitive and flexible way to manage 
    state and side effects in functional components. Here are some key reasons why hooks are valuable:</p><br/>
  <li class="ml-points">Reusability of Stateful Logic</li>
  <li class="ml-points">Simplifies Functional Components</li>
  <li class="ml-points">Avoids Class Boilerplate</li>
  <li class="ml-points">Encourages Functional Programming</li>
  <li class="ml-points">Simplifies Side Effects</li>
  <li class="ml-points">Enables Custom Hooks</li>
  <li class="ml-points">Improves Code Organization</li>
  <li class="ml-points">Enhances Performance Optimizations</li>
  <li class="ml-points">Promotes Functional Component Paradigm</li>
  <li class="ml-points">Simplifies Testing</li><br/>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">Overall, hooks provide a more modern and flexible approach to building React applications. 
    They offer a way to manage state and side effects in functional components, enabling developers to write cleaner, more modular, and reusable code. 
    This has led to their widespread adoption in the React community.</p>
