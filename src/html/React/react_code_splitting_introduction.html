  <h4 class="font-head">a.What is code splitting</h4>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    Code splitting is a technique used in web development to improve the performance and loading time of a web
    application. It involves breaking down a large JavaScript file (bundle) into smaller, more manageable chunks that
    can be loaded on demand.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    In a typical web application, all the JavaScript code required for the entire application is bundled together into a
    single file. This means that when a user visits a page, they have to download and parse this entire bundle, even if
    they only interact with a small part of the application.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    Code splitting aims to optimize this process by splitting the code into smaller chunks, and then loading only the
    necessary parts when they are actually needed. This can lead to faster initial load times and a more responsive user
    experience.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head">Advantages of Code Splitting:</h3>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    <span class="font-head">Faster Initial Load Times:</span> By only loading the code needed for the current view or
    functionality, the initial load time of the application can be significantly reduced.
  </p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    <span class="font-head">Reduced Bandwidth Usage:</span> Smaller chunks of code mean less data needs to be
    transferred over the network, which is particularly important for users on slower connections or mobile devices.
  </p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    <span class="font-head">Improved User Experience:</span> Users can start interacting with the application more
    quickly, leading to a smoother and more responsive experience.
  </p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    <span class="font-head">Better Caching:</span> Smaller code chunks are more likely to be cached by the browser,
    which can further improve subsequent page loads.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h4 class="font-head">b.Techniques for Code Splitting:</h4>
  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head">Dynamic Import (import() syntax):</h3>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    This is a feature of JavaScript that allows you to import modules dynamically at runtime. It returns a promise that
    resolves to the module.
  </p>
  <h5 class="font-head">Example:</h5>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">import("./module")</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">.then(module => {</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Use the module</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">})</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">.catch(error => {</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">&nbsp;&nbsp; // Handle error</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">});</p>
  <br />
  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head">Webpack SplitChunksPlugin:</h3>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    Webpack, a popular JavaScript bundler, has a SplitChunksPlugin that automatically splits code into separate files
    based on shared dependencies.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head">React.lazy() and Suspense:</h3>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    In React, you can use React.lazy() to dynamically import components. Combined with Suspense, you can easily
    implement code splitting for components.
  </p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">const MyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">&lt;React.Suspense fallback={ Loading... &lt;/div&gt;}&gt;</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;MyComponent /&gt;</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">&lt;/React.Suspense&gt;</p>
  <br />
  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head">Route-based Code Splitting:</h3>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    In web applications with routing, you can implement code splitting by loading different chunks for different routes.
  </p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    Code splitting is an important optimization technique, especially for large and complex web applications. It allows
    you to serve the minimum amount of code necessary for a user's current interaction, leading to a faster and more
    efficient user experience.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h4 class="font-head">c.Why do you need code splitting?</h4>
  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head">Code splitting is important for several reasons:</h3>
  <br />
  <h4 class="font-head">Faster Initial Page Load:</h4>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    Smaller initial JavaScript bundles mean quicker load times for users. They can start interacting with the page
    sooner, leading to a better user experience.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h4 class="font-head">Reduced Bandwidth Usage:</h4>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    With code splitting, users only download the code they need for the current view or interaction. This reduces the
    amount of data transferred over the network, which is crucial for users on slower connections or mobile devices.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h4 class="font-head">Improved Performance on Low-End Devices:</h4>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    Code splitting can significantly benefit users with low-end or budget devices that have limited processing power and
    memory. It allows the application to run more smoothly on these devices.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h4 class="font-head">Optimized Caching:</h4>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    Smaller code chunks are more likely to be cached by the browser. This means that subsequent visits to the same
    website can be much faster, as the browser can reuse previously loaded code.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h4 class="font-head">Efficient Resource Utilization:</h4>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    Not all parts of a web application are used at once. Code splitting allows you to load only the necessary code for
    the current view, reducing unnecessary resource consumption.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h4 class="font-head">Simplified Maintenance:</h4>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    Smaller code chunks are easier to manage and debug. It's also easier to reason about smaller pieces of code, making
    it simpler to maintain and update the application.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h4 class="font-head">Facilitates Parallel Loading:</h4>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    Code splitting enables browsers to load multiple smaller files in parallel, rather than one large file sequentially.
    This can lead to faster loading times, especially on devices with multiple CPU cores.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h4 class="font-head">Facilitates Progressive Web Apps (PWAs):</h4>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    Code splitting can be crucial for Progressive Web Apps, which aim to provide a fast and reliable user experience. By
    only loading necessary code, PWAs can achieve faster load times, even in offline or low-connectivity scenarios.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h4 class="font-head">Enables On-Demand Loading:</h4>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    Code splitting allows for on-demand loading of components or features. This is particularly useful for applications
    with complex UIs, where not all components are needed immediately.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h4 class="font-head">Enhanced Developer Experience:</h4>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    For developers, code splitting encourages modular, reusable code. It allows teams to work on smaller, more focused
    pieces of the application, making it easier to develop and maintain.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    Overall, code splitting is a powerful technique that helps optimize web applications for better performance,
    especially in scenarios where users may have varying levels of connectivity and device capabilities. It's an
    essential tool for building fast, responsive, and efficient web experiences.
