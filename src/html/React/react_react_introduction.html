  <h3 class="text-head font-head">Introduction to React</h3><br/>
  <h4 class="text-subhead font-head">What is React?</h4>
   <p class="text-content ml-content">React, and React JS are the same thing. 
    React is a popular JavaScript library that is widely used for building user interfaces for web applications. 
    Developed by Facebook, react has gained significant popularity in recent years due to its flexibility, ease of use, and efficient performance.  
    React allows you to build applications using modular and 
    reusable components that can be compared to self-contained building blocks, much like Lego blocks. 
    Each component represents a distinct element of the overall interface and can be combined with other components to create 
    the application's entire user interface.</p><br/>
  <h4 class="text-subhead font-head">Why React?</h4>
  <h5 class="text-content font-head">Now that you know — what is ReactJS used for or what is the use of React JS, you will discover why React is important. </h5>
   <p class="text-content ml-content">There are several reasons why React has become a prevalent choice for building user interfaces and what it is used for: </p><br/>
   <ol class="list-disc">
    <li class="ml-points"><span class="font-head">Declarative programming model:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>React provides a simple and intuitive programming model that allows developers to declare what they want their UI (User Interface) to look like without worrying about how it is implemented. 
    </li><br/>
    <li class="ml-points"><span class="font-head">Reusable components:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> React's component-based architecture allows developers to create reusable building blocks that can be easily combined to build complex UIs. 
    </li><br/>
    <li class="ml-points"> <span class="font-head">Virtual DOM:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The library uses a virtual representation of the actual DOM, allowing it to efficiently update the UI by only re-rendering the changed parts.
    </li></span><br/>
    <li class="ml-points"> <span class="font-head">Community support:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> React has a large and active community of developers who contribute to the project and create complementary tools and libraries.
    </li><br/>
    <li class="ml-points"> <span class="font-head">Cross-platform compatibility:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Developers use React to build UIs for various platforms, including web, mobile, and desktop applications.</li>
  </ol><br/>  
  <h4 class="text-subhead font-head">The Main React Features</h4>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">Besides being an open-source program, 
  React has features that make it an indispensable part of your web developer toolkit. 
  Here are a few of its most useful features:</p><br/> 
  <ol>
    <li class="font-semibold">JavaScript Syntax Extension (JSX)</li>
    <p class="text-content ml-content">For many web developers, 
      JSX is the better option. Although JSX is not essential for React development, a significant difference exists between writing react.js documents in JSX and JavaScript. JSX is a JavaScript syntax extension. 
      We can write HTML structures in the same file as JavaScript code.</p><br/>
    <li class="font-semibold">Virtual Document Object Model (VDOM)</li>
    <p class="text-content ml-content">ReactJS uses a virtual DOM that updates only the components that need to be updated, 
      making web applications faster and more efficient.</p><br/>
    <li class="font-semibold">Data Flow and Flux is Unidirectional</li>
    <p class="text-content ml-content">React.js is designed only to support data that flows downstream in one direction. You will require additional features if the data must flow in a different direction. React includes a set of immutable values that are passed to the component renderer as HTML tag properties. 
      The components cannot directly modify any properties, but they do support a call-back function for doing so.</p><br/>
    <li class="font-semibold">Reusable Components</li>
    <p class="text-content ml-content">React JS uses components that can be reused across different parts of the application. 
      This feature reduces the amount of code required and increases code reusability, making development more efficient.</p><br/>
    <li class="font-semibold">Debugging</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">Because of the extensive community support, testing React apps is simple. 
    Even Facebook provides a small browser extension to help with React debugging.</p> <br/> 
  <h4 class="text-subhead font-head">The Main React Components</h4>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">React components are another reason developers flock to React. React JS is a simple library built on the concept of simple component design. 
  You can think of components like Lego bricks. 
  You can build something very simple, or you can use simple designs to create things that are more complex.</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">You can write code in React either as a class or a function. </p><br/>
  <h5 class="text-content font-head">React Class Components</h5>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">Class components make up the foundation of most modern apps that are built in React. These components are simple classes, made up of functions that add utility to the application. 
  </p>
  <h5 class="text-content font-head">React Functional Components</h5>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">React functional components are just JavaScript functions used in React JS.</p> 
  You can create your own functional components by writing a common JavaScript function. </p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">Here are some of the features of the components:</p>
  <h5 class="text-content font-head">Reusability</h5> 
    <p class="text-content ml-content">Components can be reused in multiple areas of an application, accelerating development time.</p>
  <h5 class="text-content font-head">Nested Components</h5> 
    <p class="text-content ml-content">Components can contain other components within them.</p>
  <h5 class="text-content font-head">Render Method</h5>
    <p class="text-content ml-content">A component must define a render method to indicate how the component should render in its most basic form.</p>
  <h5 class="text-content font-head">Passing Properties</h5> 
    <p class="text-content ml-content">A component can accept props, properties the parent component passes to specify values.</p><br/>
  <h4 class="text-subhead font-head">React JS Prerequisites</h4>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">Before starting to learn React, you must have a basic understanding of the following concepts: </p>
  <h5 class="text-content font-head">JavaScript:</h5> 
  <p class="text-content ml-content">React is built with JavaScript and relies heavily on JavaScript syntax and concepts. You should have a good grasp of JavaScript fundamentals like variables, functions, loops, and objects, as well as newer concepts like ES6 syntax and features. </p>
  <h5 class="text-content font-head">HTML and CSS:</h5> 
  <p class="text-content ml-content">React helps build user interfaces, so you should be familiar with HTML and CSS. </p> 
  <h5 class="text-content font-head">Package managers:</h5> 
  <p class="text-content ml-content">You should be familiar with package managers like npm and yarn, which are used to install and manage external libraries and dependencies in your project. </p>
  <h5 class="text-content font-head">Git and version control:</h5> 
  <p class="text-content ml-content">Git is a popular version control system that is widely used in the development industry. You should have a basic understanding of how to use Git to manage your code changes and collaborate with other developers. </p>
  <h5 class="text-content font-head">Command line interface:</h5> 
  <p class="text-content ml-content">React development often involves working with the command line interface (CLI) 
    to run build tools, start a local server, or manage project dependencies. 
    You should have some familiarity with using the CLI to navigate the file system and execute commands.

  <h4 class="text-subhead font-head">Simple React – Hello World Program</h4>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">Here we are going to write and compile simple hello world code in react.js.</p><br/>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">Open the App.js file in a code editor. Replace its contents with the following code</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">import React from 'react';<p class="text-content ml-content">
  <p class="text-content ml-content">import './App.css';<p class="text-content ml-content">
  <p class="text-content ml-content">function App() {<p class="text-content ml-content">
  <p class="text-content ml-content">return (<p class="text-content ml-content">
  <p class="text-content ml-content"><h4 class="text-subhead font-head"> Hello World! </h4><p class="text-content ml-content">
  <p class="text-content ml-content">);<p class="text-content ml-content">
  <p class="text-content ml-content">}<p class="text-content ml-content">
  <p class="text-content ml-content">export default App;<p class="text-content ml-content"><br/>
    <p class="text-content ml-content">Save the above code in app.js file then the output will be displayed in the output block</p>
  <h4 class="text-subhead font-head">Hello World!<h4 class="text-subhead font-head"><br/>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">We can display any name instead of hello world in the above code.</p>
