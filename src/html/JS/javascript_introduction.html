  <br />
  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head"><b>What is JavaScript?</b></h3>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”. The programs in this language are called scripts. They
    can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads. Scripts are provided and executed
    as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.
  </p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called ECMAScript, and
    now it has no relation to Java at all.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head"><b>Why is it called JavaScript?</b></h3>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “Live Script”. But Java was very popular at that time,
    so it was decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head"><b>Features of JavaScript</b></h3>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">There are following features of JavaScript:</p>
  <ol class="list-disc">
    <li class="ml-points">
      All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.
    </li>
    <li class="ml-points">
      JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured programming
      language.
    </li>
    <li class="ml-points">
      JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast (depending on the operation).
    </li>
    <li class="ml-points">
      JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for
      inheritance.
    </li>
    <li class="ml-points">It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.</li>
    <li class="ml-points">It is a case-sensitive language.</li>
    <li class="ml-points">JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.</li>
    <li class="ml-points">It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.</li>
    <li class="ml-points">Can handle date and time.</li>
    <li class="ml-points">No compiler is needed.</li>
  </ol>
  <br />
  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head"><b>Applications of JavaScript</b></h3>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    JavaScript is an incredibly versatile programming language that finds applications in various domains. Here are some
    of the key areas where JavaScript is commonly used:

  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head"><b>Code editors</b></h3>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    A code editor is the place where programmers spend most of their time.There are two main types of code editors: IDEs
    and lightweight editors. Many people use one tool of each type.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h4><b>IDE</b></h4>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    The term IDE (Integrated Development Environment) refers to a powerful editor with many features that usually
    operates on a “whole project.” As the name suggests, it’s not just an editor, but a full-scale “development
    environment.”
  </p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    An IDE loads the project (which can be many files), allows navigation between files, provides autocompletion based
    on the whole project (not just the open file), and integrates with a version management system (like git), a testing
    environment, and other “project-level” stuff.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h4><b>Lightweight editors</b></h4>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    “Lightweight editors” are not as powerful as IDEs, but they’re fast, elegant and simple. They are mainly used to
    open and edit a file instantly.
  </p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    The main difference between a “lightweight editor” and an “IDE” is that an IDE works on a project-level, so it loads
    much more data on start, analyzes the project structure if needed and so on. A lightweight editor is much faster if
    we need only one file.
  </p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    In practice, lightweight editors may have a lot of plugins including directory-level syntax analyzers and auto
    completers, so there’s no strict border between a lightweight editor and an IDE.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head"><b>Fun with JavaScript </b></h3>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    There are multiple ways to print "Hello World" in JavaScript, and for that, we first must know how to insert
    JavaScript code in an HTML file using the &lt;script&gt; tag. We can also control the loading and execution behavior
    of a script using the async and defer attributes provided by HTML5.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    If you ask programmers what was their first program? Most of them would say the "Hello, World" program.
  </p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    It is a simple program that prints a Hello, World! message on the screen, and it’s a good way to make sure your
    development environment is properly configured.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p class="text-content ml-content">Different ways to write the Hello World in JavaScript.</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">We will use these three ways to print 'Hello, World!'</p>
  <li class="ml-points">console.log()</li>
  <li class="ml-points">alert()</li>
  <li class="ml-points">document.write()</li>
  <h4><b>Using console.log()</b></h4>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    The console.log() is a function used to log messages on the web console. A function in programming is like a black
    box that takes an input and returns an output by doing some processing. function
  </p>
  <br />
  <p class="text-content ml-content">Let's use console.log to print Hello, World!:</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">&lt;script&gt;</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log("Hello, World!")</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">&lt;/script&gt;</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    In our case, the console.log takes the text we want to display as input and prints it on the screen as the output.
  </p>
  <br />
  <b>Output:</b>
  <p>
    To see the output, open the HTML file with this script in your browser and press F12 or right-click and select
    inspect then switch to the second tab named console.
  </p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">You will find the following output:</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">&nbsp;&nbsp;using console.log.jpg</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    console.log() is often used in debugging the code (finding and fixing the errors).
  </p>
  <br />
  <h4><b>Using document.write()</b></h4>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    document.write() is another function you can use to print Hello World in JavaScript. Unlike console.log it prints
    the message on the HTML document instead of the console.
  </p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">Let's try it as follow:</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">&lt;script&gt;</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;document.write("Hello, World!");</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">&lt;/script&gt;</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">To see the output, open the HTML document in your browser</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">Using document.write().jpg</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    There is a better alternative to display text on an HTML document using DOM manipulation which is not difficult but
    beyond the scope of this article.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h4><b> Using alert()</b></h4>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    The last function we will use to print Hello World in JavaScript is alert.This function displays a pop-up box over
    the current window with the specified message.
  </p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">&lt;script&gt;</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert("Hello, World!");</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">&lt;/script&gt;</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">using alert.jpg</p>
  <br />
  <h4><b>Hello World without html</b></h4>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    Certainly! To print "Hello, World!" in JavaScript, you can use the following code:
  </p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">console.log("Hello, World!");</p>
  <br />
  <p class="text-content ml-content font-semibold">Here's what this code does:</p>
  <li class="ml-points">console is an object in JavaScript that provides access to the browser's debugging console.</li>
  <li class="ml-points">log is a method of the console object used to output messages to the console.</li>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    The string "Hello, World!" is passed as an argument to the log method, which will then be displayed in the console
    when you run the program.
  </p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    If you're running this in a Node.js environment, you can save the code in a file with a .js extension (e.g.,
    hello.js) and run it using the command node hello.js in your terminal.
  </p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">Running the above code will output:</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">Hello, World!</p>
