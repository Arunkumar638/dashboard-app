  <h4 class="text-subhead font-head">What is Python?</h4>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    Python is a high-level, versatile, and dynamically-typed programming language. 
    It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. 
    Python is designed to be easy to read and write, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced developers alike.

  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head">Why Python?</h3>
  <ol class="list-disc">
    <li class="ml-points">It works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).</li>
    <li class="ml-points">It has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
    <li class="ml-points">It has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.</li>
    <li class="ml-points">It runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.</li>
    <li class="ml-points">It can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</li>
  </ol><br/>
  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head">Python Syntax</h3>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line </p><br/>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">>>> print("Hello, World!")</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">Hello, World!</p><br/>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py</p><br/>
  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head">Simple Python Program</h3>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">Write a simple python program to print Hello World.</p><br/>
  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head">Source Code:</h3>
  <p class="text-content ml-content"># This program prints Hello, world!</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">print('Hello, world!')</p><br/>
  <h1 class="text-subhead font-head">Output</h1>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">Hello, world!</p><br/>
