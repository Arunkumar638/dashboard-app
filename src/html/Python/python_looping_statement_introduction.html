  <h4 class="text-subhead font-head">Loops</h4>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    The flow of the programs written in any programming language is sequential by default. The first statement in a
    function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when the programmer needs to
    execute a block of code several times. For this purpose, The programming languages provide various kinds of loops
    that are able to repeat some particular code numerous numbers of times. Here, we are going to talk about looping
    statements in Python.

    Looping simplifies complicated problems into smooth ones. It allows programmers to modify the flow of the program so
    that rather than writing the same code, again and again, programmers are able to repeat the code a finite number of
    times.
