      Python comments are lines of text that are ignored by the Python interpreter when the code is executed.
    </li>
    <li class="ml-content">They are used to provide explanatory notes or documentation within the code.</li>
    <li class="ml-content">
      Comments are essential for making code more readable and understandable, both for the original developer and for
      others who may work with or review the code.

  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head">Creating a Comment</h3>
  <ol>
    <li class="ml-content">Comments starts with aÂ #, and Python will ignore them</li>
    <li class="ml-content">
      Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line.
    </li>

  <br />
  <p class="text-content ml-content">There are two main types of comments in Python</p>
  <ol class="list-disc">
    <li class="ml-points">Single line comment</li>
    <li class="ml-points">Multi line comment</li>
  </ol>
  <br />
  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head">Single-line Comments:</h3>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    Single-line comments begin with the # symbol and extend until the end of the line. They are used for short, one-line
    explanations.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p class="text-content font-head">Example:</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content"># This is a single-line comment</p>
  <br />
  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head">Multi-line Comments (Docstrings):</h3>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    Multi-line comments are used for more detailed explanations and documentation. In Python, these are often referred
    to as "docstrings." They are enclosed in triple quotes (''' or """) and can span multiple lines.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p class="text-content font-head">Example:</p>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    " This is a multi-line comment. It can span multiple lines. It is often used for function and module documentation.
