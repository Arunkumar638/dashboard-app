    Exceptions are raised when the program is syntactically correct, but the code results in an error. This error does
    not stop the execution of the program, however, it changes the normal flow of the program.

  <h4 class="text-subhead font-head">Python Exception Handling</h4>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    We know that exceptions abnormally terminate the execution of a program. This is why it is important to handle
    exceptions. In Python, there are several built-in exceptions that can be raised when an error occurs during the
    execution of a program.
