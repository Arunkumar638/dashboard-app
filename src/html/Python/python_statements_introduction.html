    In programming languages, most of the time in large projects we have to control the flow of execution of our program
    and we want to execute some set of statements only if the given condition is satisfied, and a different set of
    statements when itâ€™s not satisfied.

    A Python statement is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute. There are different types of
    statements in Python language as Assignment statements, Conditional statements, Looping statements, etc. The token
