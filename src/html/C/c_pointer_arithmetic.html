  <h2><b>Pointer arithmetic</b></h2>
  Pointer arithmetic is a feature in C that allows you to perform arithmetic operations on pointers. This is possible
  because pointers are just memory addresses, and their values are typically integers representing locations in
  memory.<br />

  Here are some important things to know about pointer arithmetic:<br />

  <b>Increment and Decrement:</b><br />

  You can increment and decrement a pointer by an integer value. The size of the increment or decrement is based on the
  data type the pointer is pointing to.<br />
  int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};<br />
  int *ptr = arr; // ptr points to the first element of arr<br />

  ptr++; // Moves ptr to the next integer location in memory<br />
  <b>Addition and Subtraction:</b><br />

  You can add or subtract an integer from a pointer. Again, the size of the increment or decrement is based on the data
  type.<br />
  int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};<br />
  int *ptr = arr; // ptr points to the first element of arr<br />

  ptr = ptr + 2; // Moves ptr two elements ahead (8 bytes for integers)<br />
  <b>Array Indexing:</b><br />

  Array indexing can be viewed as a form of pointer arithmetic. The expression arr[i] is equivalent to *(arr + i), where
  arr is a pointer to the first element of the array.<br />
  int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};<br />
  int *ptr = arr; // ptr points to the first element of arr<br />

  printf("%d\n", *(ptr + 2)); // This will print the value 3<br />
  P<b>ointer Differences:</b><br />

  You can subtract one pointer from another, as long as they are both pointers to the same data type. The result will be
  the number of elements between them.<br />

  int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};<br />
  int *ptr1 = arr; // ptr1 points to the first element of arr<br />
  int *ptr2 = arr + 3; // ptr2 points to the fourth element of arr<br />

  int diff = ptr2 - ptr1; // diff will be 3, because there are 3 elements between ptr1 and ptr2<br />
  <b>Void Pointers and Pointer Arithmetic:</b><br />

  Void pointers (void*) cannot be directly dereferenced, but they can be typecasted to other pointer types to perform
  pointer arithmetic. Be cautious, as typecasting a void pointer incorrectly can lead to undefined behavior.<br />
  Pointer arithmetic is a powerful feature, but it also requires caution. You must ensure that you are performing
  operations on valid memory locations to avoid undefined behavior or memory access violations. Additionally, it's
  important to be aware of the size of the data type being pointed to, as this affects the behavior of pointer
  arithmetic.<br />
