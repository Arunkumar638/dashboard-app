  <h2 class="text-head font-head"><b>Comments</b></h2>
  <div class="text-content ml-content">
    In programming, comments are hints that a programmer can add to make their code easier to read and understand. For
    example,<br />
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br />
    int main() {<br />
    // print Hello World to the screen<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;printf("Hello World");<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;return 0;<br />
    }<br />
    <b>Output</b><br />
    Hello World<br />
    Here, // print Hello World to the screen is a comment in C programming. Comments are completely ignored by C
    compilers.
  </div>
  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head"><b>Types of Comments</b></h3>
  <div class="text-content ml-content">
    There are two ways to add comments in C:<br />
    <ol>
      <li>// - Single Line Comment</li>
      <br />
      <li>/*...*/ - Multi-line Comment</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <b>Single-line Comments in C</b><br />
    In C, a single line comment starts with //. It starts and ends in the same line. For example,<br />
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br />
    int main() {<br />
    // create integer variable&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;int age = 25; <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;// print the age variable<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;printf("Age: %d", age);<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;return 0;<br />
    }<br />
    <b>Output</b><br />
    Age: 25<br />
    In the above example, // create integer variable and // print the age variable are two single line comments.<br />
    We can also use the single line comment along with the code. For example,<br />
    int age = 25;&nbsp;&nbsp;// create integer variable<br />
    Here, code before // are executed and code after // are ignored by the compiler.
  </div>
  <h4><b> Multi-line Comments in C</b></h4>
  <div class="text-content ml-content">
    In C programming, there is another type of comment that allows us to comment on multiple lines at once, they are
    multi-line comments.<br />
    To write multi-line comments, we use the /*....*/ symbol. For example,<br />
    /* This program takes age input from the user<br />
    It stores it in the age variable<br />
    And, print the value using printf() */<br />
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br />
    int main() {<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;int age;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;printf("Enter the age: ");<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;scanf("%d", &age);<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;printf("Age = %d", age);<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;return 0;<br />
    }<br />
    <b>Output</b><br />
    Enter the age: 24<br />
    Age = 24<br />
    In this type of comment, the C compiler ignores everything from /* to */.
  </div>
  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head"><b>Use of Comments in C</b></h3>
  <div class="text-content ml-content">
    <b>1. Make Code Easier to Understand</b><br />
    If we write comments on our code, it will be easier to understand the code in the future. Otherwise, you will end up
    spending a lot of time looking at our own code and trying to understand it.<br />
    Comments are even more important if you are working in a group. It makes it easier for other developers to
    understand and use your code.<br />
    <b>2. Using Comments for debugging</b><br />
    While debugging, there might be situations where we don't want some part of the code. For example,<br />
    In the program below, suppose we don't need data related to height. So, instead of removing the code related to
    height, we can simply convert them into comments.<br />
    // Program to take age and height input<br />
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br />
    int main() {<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int age;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;// double height;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf("Enter the age: ");<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;scanf("%d", &age);<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;// printf("Enter the height: ");<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;// scanf("%lf", &height);<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf("Age = %d", age);<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;// printf("\nHeight = %.1lf", height);<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;return 0;<br />
    }<br />
    Now later on, if we need height again, all you need to do is remove the forward slashes. And, they will now become
    statements not comments.<br /><br />
    <b>Note:</b> Comments are not and should not be used as a substitute to explain poorly written code. Always try to
    write clean, understandable code, and then use comments as an addition. In most cases, always use comments to
    explain 'why' rather than 'how' and you are good to go.
