  <h2 class="text-head font-head"><b>Constants in C</b></h2>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    The constants in C are the read-only variables whose values cannot be modified once they are declared in the C
    program. The type of constant can be an integer constant, a floating pointer constant, a string constant, or a
    character constant. In C language, the const keyword is used to define the constants.

  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head"><b>What is a constant in C?</b></h3>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    As the name suggests, a constant in C is a variable that cannot be modified once it is declared in the program. We
    cannot make any change in the value of the constant variables after they are defined.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head"><b>How to Define Constant in C?</b></h3>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    We define a constant in C language using the const keyword. Also known as a const type qualifier, the const keyword
    is placed at the start of the variable declaration to declare that variable as a constant.<br />
    Syntax to Define Constant<br />
    const data_type var_name = value;<br /><br />
    <img src="/Assets/Example of Constants in C.jpg" height="400" width="400" /><br />
    // C program to illustrate constant variable definition<br />
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br />
    int main()<br />
    {<br />
    // defining integer constant using const keyword<br />
    const int int_const = 25;<br />
    // defining character constant using const keyword<br />
    const char char_const = 'A';<br />
    // defining float constant using const keyword<br />
    const float float_const = 15.66;<br />
    printf("Printing value of Integer Constant: %d\n", int_const);<br />
    printf("Printing value of Character Constant: %c\n", char_const);<br />
    printf("Printing value of Float Constant: %f", float_const);<br />
    return 0;<br />
    }<br />
    <b>Output</b><br />
    Printing value of Integer Constant: 25<br />
    Printing value of Character Constant: A<br />
    Printing value of Float Constant: 15.660000<br />
    One thing to note here is that we have to initialize the constant variables at declaration. Otherwise, the variable
    will store some garbage value and we wonâ€™t be able to change it. The following image describes examples of incorrect
    and correct variable definitions.

  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head"><b>Types of Constants in C</b></h3>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    The type of the constant is the same as the data type of the variables. Following is the list of the types of
    constants
    <li>Integer Constant</li>
    <li>Character Constant</li>
    <li>Floating Point Constant</li>
    <li>Double Precision Floating Point Constant</li>
    <li>Array Constant</li>
    <li>Structure Constant</li>
    We just have to add the const keyword at the start of the variable declaration.

  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head"><b>Properties of Constant in C</b></h3>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    The important properties of constant variables in C defined using the const keyword are as follows:<br />
    <b>1. Initialization with Declaration</b>
    We can only initialize the constant variable in C at the time of its declaration. Otherwise, it will store the
    garbage value.<br />
    <b>2. Immutability</b>
    The constant variables in c are immutable after its definition, i.e., they can be initialized only once in the whole
    program. After that, we cannot modify the value stored inside that variable.<br />
    // C Program to demonstrate the behaviour of constant<br />
    // variable<br />
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br />
    int main()<br />
    {<br />
    // declaring a constant variable<br />
    const int var;<br />
    // initializing constant variable var after declaration<br />
    var = 20;<br />
    printf("Value of var: %d", var);<br />
    return 0;<br />
    }<br />
    <b>Output</b><br />
    In function 'main':<br />
    10:9: error: assignment of read-only variable 'var'<br />
    10 | var = 20;<br />

  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head"><b>Difference Between Constants and Literals</b></h3>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    The constant and literals are often confused as the same. But in C language, they are different entities and have
    different semantics. The following table lists the differences between the constants and literals in C:

  <h3 class="text-subhead font-head"><b>Defining Constant using #define Preprocessor</b></h3>
  <p class="text-content ml-content">
    We can also define a constant in C using #define preprocessor. The constants defined using #define are macros that
    behave like a constant. These constants are not handled by the compiler, they are handled by the preprocessor and
    are replaced by their value before complication.<br />
    #define const_name value<br />
    <b>Example of Constant Macro</b><br />
    // C Program to define a constant using #define<br />
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br />
    #define pi 3.14<br />
    int main()<br />
    {<br />
    printf("The value of pi: %.2f", pi);<br />
    return 0;<br />
    }<br />
    <b>Output</b><br />
    The value of pi: 3.14
