  <h2 class="text-head font-head">Pointer and types of Pointers in c</h2>
  <div class="text-content ml-content">In C programming, a pointer is a variable that holds the memory address of another variable. It allows you to indirectly access a variable by its address rather than its value. This can be useful for tasks like dynamic memory allocation, working with arrays, and passing parameters to functions by reference.<br/>
  
  Here are some important points about pointers in C:
  </div><br/>
  
  <div class="text-subhead font-head">Declaring Pointers:</div>
  
  <div class="text-content ml-content">To declare a pointer, you use the * (asterisk) symbol followed by the data type. For example:<br/>
  int *ptr;  // Declares a pointer to an integer<br/>
  float *ptr2;  // Declares a pointer to a float
  </div><br/>
  <div class="text-subhead font-head">Initializing Pointers:</div>
  
  <div class="text-content ml-content">Pointers should be initialized before they are used. They can be assigned the address of an existing variable using the & (address of) operator. For example:<br/>
  int num = 10;<br/>
  int *ptr = &num;  // ptr now points to the memory location of 'num'</div><br/>
  <div class="text-subhead font-head">Accessing Value through Pointers:</div>
  
  <div class="text-content ml-content">You can access the value pointed to by a pointer using the * (dereference) operator. For example:<br/>
  int num = 10;<br/>
  int *ptr = &num;<br/>
  printf("%d", *ptr);  // This will print the value of 'num', which is 10
  </div><br/>
  <div class="text-subhead font-head">NULL Pointers:</div>
  
  <div class="text-content ml-content">A pointer that is not initialized is called a null pointer. It doesn't point to any valid memory location. 
    It's a good practice to initialize pointers to NULL if you don't have a valid address to assign initially.
  </div><br/>
  <div class="text-subhead font-head">Pointer Arithmetic:</div>
  
  <div class="text-content ml-content">Pointers in C can be manipulated using arithmetic operations. For example, if ptr points to an integer, then ptr + 1 
    will point to the next integer location in memory.
  </div><br/>
  <div class="text-subhead font-head">Types of Pointers:</div>
  <div class="text-content ml-content"> 
  <b>Integer Pointers (int*):</b> These pointers are used to store the address of an integer variable.<br/><br/>
  <b>Float Pointers (float*):</b> These pointers are used to store the address of a float variable.<br/><br/>
  <b>Character Pointers (char*):</b> These pointers are used to store the address of a character variable.<br/><br/>
  <b>Void Pointers (void*):</b> These are generic pointers that can point to any type. They are often used with dynamic memory allocation functions like malloc.<br/><br/>
  <b>Pointer to Pointer:</b><br/>
  
  You can have pointers that point to other pointers. These are known as double pointers or pointers to pointers. They are declared using multiple * symbols.<br/><br/> 
  <b>For example:</b><br/>
  int num = 10;<br/>
  int *ptr = &num;<br/>
  int **ptr_to_ptr = &amp;ptr;  // ptr_to_ptr is a pointer to a pointer to an integer
</div><br/>
  <div class="text-subhead font-head">Arrays and Pointers:</div>
  
  <div class="text-content ml-content">Arrays can be accessed using pointers. In fact, the name of an array is essentially a pointer to the first element of the array.</div><br/>
  <div class="text-subhead font-head">Function Pointers:</div>
  
  <div class="text-content ml-content">
  <li>Pointers can also point to functions. This allows you to call different functions at runtime, depending on which function the pointer is pointing to.</li><br/>
  <li>Understanding pointers is crucial for advanced C programming, especially for tasks like dynamic memory allocation and working with complex data structures.</li><br/>
  <li>However, improper use of pointers can lead to bugs like segmentation faults, so it's important to handle them carefully.</li>
