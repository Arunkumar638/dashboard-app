  <h3><b>Strings in c</b></h3>
  In C programming, a "string" is a sequence of characters that represents text. It is stored as an array of characters,
  terminated by a null character ('\0') which marks the end of the string. Here are some key points about strings in
  C:<br />
  <b>String Literal:</b> A string literal is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes ("). <br />For example,
  "Hello" is a string literal.<br />
  <b>Character Array:</b> In C, strings are represented as arrays of characters. You can declare a string as follows:<br />
  char myString[6] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};<br />
  or more commonly using string literals:<br />
  char myString[] = "Hello";<br />
  In the second example, the compiler automatically determines the size of the array based on the length of the
  string.<br />
  Null Termination: Strings in C are null-terminated, meaning that the last character in the string is '\0'. This is how
  C knows where the string ends.<br />
  <b>String Handling Functions:</b> C provides a number of functions for working with strings in the string.h header
  file. Some commonly used functions include strlen, strcpy, strcat, strcmp, etc.<br />
  <b>String Input:</b> You can use the scanf function to read a string from the user, but it's recommended to use fgets
  for safer input handling.<br />
  <b>String Output:</b> You can use printf to print strings to the console.<br />
  <b>String Manipulation:</b> You can manipulate strings by assigning new values to individual characters or by using
  string manipulation functions.<br />
  <b>String Comparison:</b> You can compare two strings using functions like strcmp, which returns a value indicating
  the lexicographical relationship between the strings.<br />
  <b>String Concatenation:</b> You can concatenate two strings using the strcat function or by using the strncat
  function if you want to limit the number of characters to concatenate.<br />
  <b>String Copy:</b> You can copy one string to another using the strcpy function, or use strncpy if you want to
  specify a maximum number of characters to copy.<br />
  <b>String Length:</b> You can find the length of a string (excluding the null terminator) using the strlen
  function.<br />
  Here's an example of a C program that demonstrates some basic string operations: #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br />
  #include &lt;string.h&gt;<br />
  int main() {<br />
  char myString[] = "Hello";<br />
  printf("The length of the string is: %d\n", strlen(myString));<br />
  char anotherString[20];<br />
  strcpy(anotherString, "World");<br />
  printf("Concatenated string: %s\n", strcat(myString, anotherString));<br />
  return 0;<br />
  }<br />
  This program declares two strings, calculates the length of the first string, and then concatenates the two strings
  using strcat. Keep in mind that you need to have enough space allocated in the destination string to accommodate the
  concatenated result.<br />
  <h3><b>C gets and puts method for string</b></h3>
  <br />
  In C programming, gets and puts are standard library functions used for reading and writing strings, respectively.
  However, it's important to note that gets has been deprecated in C11 and removed from C99, and it is considered unsafe
  due to the lack of bounds checking. It's recommended to use fgets instead for safer string input.<br />
  Here's a brief explanation of gets and puts:<br />
  gets Function (Deprecated)<br />
  The gets function is used to read a line of text from the standard input (usually the keyboard) and store it as a
  string. It reads characters until a newline ('\n') character is encountered, and then it adds a null character ('\0')
  to mark the end of the string.<br />
  <b>Example of gets:</b><br />
  char myString[50];<br />
  printf("Enter a string: ");<br />
  gets(myString); // Deprecated and unsafe, don't use in modern C programming<br />
  puts Function<br />
  The puts function is used to print a string to the standard output (usually the console) followed by a newline
  character ('\n').<br />
  <b>Example of puts:</b><br />
  char myString[] = "Hello, World!";<br />
  puts(myString);<br />
  <h4><b>Using fgets for Safer Input</b></h4>
  Instead of using gets, it's recommended to use fgets for reading strings as it allows you to specify a maximum number
  of characters to read, which helps prevent buffer overflow.<br />
  <b>Example of fgets:</b><br />
  char myString[50];<br />
  printf("Enter a string: ");<br />
  fgets(myString, sizeof(myString), stdin);<br />
  In this example, fgets reads up to sizeof(myString)-1 characters (to leave room for the null terminator) from the
  standard input (specified by stdin) and stores them in myString.<br />
  It ensures that the input will not exceed the allocated buffer size.<br />
  <h3><b>C String Functions</b></h3>
